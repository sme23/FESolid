trying to understand these checks...

address = 0x4000008
storeFirst = true
restoreAfter = true
expected = 0xDFFF
restore = 0


vu16* address = 0x4000008;
original = *address;
*address = 0xFFFF;

@if this doesnt work check the test rom around 8001A90
ldr r1,=#0x4000008
ldr r0,=#0xFFFFFFFF
strh r0,[r1]
ldrh r0,[r1]
@if r0=DFFF, we're on real hardware or a good emulator
@if r0=DFCF, we're on VBA
@if r0=FFFF, we're on VGBA

ldr r1,=#0x4000062
ldr r0,=#0xFFFFFFFF
strh r0,[r1]
ldrh r0,[r1]
@if r0=FFC0, we're on real hardware or a good emulator
@if r0=47FF, we're on mGBA

@two more tests that work differently for checking no$ and higan
@hmm how do these work
@both should be ROM -> IWRAM DMA transfers
@channel 0?
@anyhow we're checking the result of a DMA transfer? i think


@new plan: higan sucks so don't even check for it
@do the existing check that VBA & no$ fail, assume no$ if failed after the above (assuming the above works)
